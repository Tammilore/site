If you know me well, you might be taken back by this ‚òùüèΩ. I'm not proud of it, I'm not ashamed either but I can be terribly lazy. I'm just very particular about the kind of work I want to stress myself with. So for me coding has always been something I was too lazy to try. It's the entire reason I ran to no-code.

Late last year a friend who is a dev said I would ditch no-code if I knew how to code. Laziness aside, I really love no-code. It's more than fancy tools and interfaces, it's empowerment to all the people who for whatever reason can't code but are builders at heart.

I disagreed with him.

Anyway, I finally decided to learn and based off how many times I've yelled at my laptop screen and had recurring dreams of a function that just wouldn't work, I would still choose no-code.

I'm not a pro at the coding thing but my point stands. That aside, it hasn't been all bad. I've learnt a lot of stuff and it feels nice to be a part of both worlds. I also now know for sure if that pagination issue the dev says would take 2 weeks should actually take that long.

So far:

- I‚Äôve built a web app (React), APIs (Nodejs and Python), a desktop app and a vscode extension
- I still prefer backend
- I suck at frontend
- Navigating AWS is unnecessarily stressful so thank heaven for Porter
- AI is great. Mostly.
- My code is riddled with paragraph long notes. I should automate that
- Installing Python almost made me cry
- Long code contexts in ChatGPT reduces the chances of better responses
- One of my new favorite things to do is read open source github repos
- I still defer to no-code.
