I like to think I'm an idea person. I get a ton of them everyday and sure some are great and some are not but nine out of ten times no matter how great they are, I just don't want to work on them.

There a bunch of reasons why I find it hard to pick an idea to work on but before I get to that, there are a few things on coming up with new ideas that I don't entirely agree with.

For one, I don't think it has to be from a problem I've faced and of course you can disagree with that. I understand having a personal connection to the problem drives your story telling and may give a bit more edge but I do think it's possible to see a shit problem that you get so obsessed by that you study it in and out, talk to as many people as possible and want to provide a solution.

Secondly and this is kind of a question. They say build pain killers not vitamins but isn't one man's vitamin another man's pain killer? Just saying.

For me to work on an idea, I have to be completely psyched by it. It has to keep me tinkering and thinking and I'm not talking about vague curiosity. This part is easy, it's the fun part. The new shiny thing that gets my eye and I have to figure out how it works or how to get it to work.

The second part is where I need to know as many people as possible who are working on a similar idea. I need to know what they know, how they do it, what I **_think_** they don't know and how I can use that to my own advantage.

I like to call this friendly stalking ðŸ‘€. I read through blog posts, technical articles, features, as many version of pitch decks or memos that I can find, tweets and of course I sign up.

Sometimes I find these people but nothing useful to learn about them. Other times I learn a lot but can't think of anything to do better and then there are times when I don't even find them at all. If any of these happen no matter how psyched I was by the idea, my love for it dies.

The final part is my criticism test. I try not to dwell too much on all the reasons why the idea is great. Instead I think of all the reasons why it is not; all the ways it could go wrong, all the holes it could have and stuff like that.

Basically I rubbish the idea as hard as I can then try to find a fix for the problems and if it's still standing after all the break and tear then I've found my idea. But if it isn't or if I can't think of one single bad thing about the idea then you know.

Sometimes I try to fight this structure in my head so I can just build something and have fun with it and so I don't overthink everything but I'm not quite there yet.

I recently discontinued [Zing](https://www.zingfi.co/) but I'm excited to see use cases for payroll data soon. To finally wrap it up, I'm working on an open-source transaction enrichment engine, I'll write on that later. Fingers crossed.
