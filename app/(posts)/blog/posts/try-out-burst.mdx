> ðŸ”” This project is still progressing. Look through my blog posts for updates.

Itâ€™s been sometime since my last update on Burst but I spent the last week working on the making a very early version available for everyone to try out.

The converter supports all the elements Iâ€™ve been able to convert sides from Images. Iâ€™ll add that sometime later. In the mean time, here are some things to know:

### How To Use

- Go to the settings page of your Bubble application, under the General tab youâ€™ll find the option to export your application. This will download a file on your system.
- Open and copy the content of the file then paste into the converter.
- Youâ€™ll see a list of pages with supported elements that have been identified from your app in a dropdown. Choose the one that you will like to convert.
- Run the conversion and view the converted code in a sandbox.

### Known Issues

- **Ordering discrepancies:** Sometimes, the Bubble JSON doesn't reflect the visual arrangement in the editor so the generated code may be wrongly ordered.
- **Naming conventions:** You have to properly label or rename all your elements for smoother code conversion.
- **Style limitations:** Thereâ€™s currently no support for Bubble's style libraries or components.
- **Color definitions:** Define colors explicitly (e.g., use `#ffffff` instead of "Primary color").
- **Font consistency:** All converted code currently uses a single font so for now, your application font wonâ€™t be reflected in the conversion.

### Things To Note

- Use sample applications that have simple pages including only the elements currently supported by the converter.
- Conversions that encounter issues may be logged sometimes to help identify and fix problems.
- Only the Bubble JSON shared by you is accessed, it does not have unlimited access to your live application.
- Burst is still in its early stages, so its not perfect yet.

### Feedback

If you would like to give feedback about a conversion, you can:

- [Submit an issue](https://github.com/Tammilore/burst-oss/issues) with details of your applicationâ€™s JSON, the page you tried to convert and the sandbox link.
- Send me an [email](mailto:tammilore@gmail.com)
- Record a [Jam](https://jam.dev/) or a Loom video
