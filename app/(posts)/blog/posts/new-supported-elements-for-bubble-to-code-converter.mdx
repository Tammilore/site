> ðŸ”” This project is still progressing. Look through my blog posts for updates.

Itâ€™s been over a month since my last update on this but I finally had some time and added support for three new elements.

So far, Burst can convert these elements in your Bubble application to code:

- [x] Texts
- [x] Groups
- [x] Buttons
- [x] Inputs
- [x] Multiline Inputs
- [x] Images

That's how many more to go? ðŸ‘€

These are some of the major elements for any simple web page so you can pretty much convert a simple landing page or signup page to basic HTML and CSS.

The next thing I want to do is put together a simple application so anyone can test it out and try converting their pages in real time. This way, I can get more feedback and understand how to fix any weird cases that I havenâ€™t thought of. If that works out well enough, Iâ€™ll move on to converting the complex elements. If you'd like to help run tests and export your applications to code, [let me know](https://tally.so/r/w8dGxo).

As usual, hereâ€™s a [demo] (https://www.loom.com/share/6299927d32bb470b974a811a7ad06b0b?sid=b87b6c59-6c69-4ae2-aad4-0d83bbd570a6)
