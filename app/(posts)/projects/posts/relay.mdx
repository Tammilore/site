# Key Features

- **Capture Requests**: Automatically capture HTTP/HTTPS API requests from your browser.
- **Edit & Replay**: Modify captured requests and replay them with one click.
- **Save Sessions**: Keep a history of your sessions for easier access and analysis.
- **Real-time Editing**: Adjust headers, parameters, and body content directly.
- **Run Requests**: Execute API requests within the browser and get instant feedback.
- **No Postman Required**: No need for external applications, just run everything in the extension.

## Capturing Requests

Relay makes it simple to monitor and store network activity in real time. By using Chrome's Debugger API, it tracks every request and response within a browser tab, helping developers debug faster and better.

Here’s how it works:

- Capture Requests: It records key details like the request URL, HTTP method, headers, query parameters, and payload.
- Store Responses: When a response is received, it adds extra information like status codes, headers, and how long the request took.
- Filter What You Need: You can focus on specific requests by filtering for certain methods or URLs.
- Keep a History: All the data is saved using `@plasmohq/storage`, so you can revisit it even after closing or refreshing.

```ts 
// Capture and store network requests
chrome.debugger.onEvent.addListener((source, eventMethod, params: any) => {
  if (eventMethod === "Network.requestWillBeSent" && params.requestId) {
    requests[params.requestId] = {
      url: params.request.url,
      method: params.request.method,
      startTime: performance.now(),
    };
  }

  if (eventMethod === "Network.responseReceived" && params.requestId) {
    const request = requests[params.requestId];
    if (request) {
      const duration = `${Math.round(performance.now() - request.startTime)}ms`;
      request.duration = duration;

      // Store request in storage
      storage.get("apiRequests").then((stored) => {
        storage.set("apiRequests", [...(stored || []), request]);
        console.log("Saved request:", request);
      });
    }
  }
})
```
### Why It’s Useful

Debugging network issues can be time-consuming. Relay helps by:

- Showing all the request and response details in one place.
- Highlighting how long requests take to spot slow APIs.
- Saving everything for later reference.
