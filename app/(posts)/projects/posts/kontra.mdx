## Analyzing Contracts
Kontra takes in the uploaded file or pasted text to PDF and then analyzes it by extracting the specific clause, the level of risk and the suggsetion or details of what should be taken note of/avoided.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Converts to PDF : It converts the uploaded file or pasted text to PDF format.
- Uploads the PDF on Supabase: It uploads the document to Supabase storage and returns the signed url.
- Analyzes and extracts structured data: It passes the URL to Documind to analyze the contract and then extract structured data.
- Outputs the analysis - It returns the analysis of ach clause, their risk level and highlights their position on the document.

```ts 
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { extract, formatter } from "documind";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

interface Issue {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
}

  id: string;
  type: string;
  range: [number, number];
}

      return NextResponse.json({ error: "File URL is required" }, { status: 400 });
    }

    // Analyze the contract
